# Brand Guidance #
Our Brand team provides foundational guidance on how to represent Pendo in online content. These guidelines are the touchpoint that we start from as product writers. We enhance and add to these guidelines as we build out product content in UX writing, guides, and help center articles. We don't deviate from these guidelines unless it's necessary to properly address a user in context.

The entire Brand style guide, including images and colors, is available at [https://brand.pendo.io](https://brand.pendo.io).

## Our style ##
As an expression of our brand, our copy should express our brand attributes. We aspire to be:

### DEPENDABLE ###
Our communications should create value, provide expertise, and offer support.

### PASSIONATE ###
We are our customers' biggest fans and most dedicated coaches. That does not mean you need to end every sentence with an exclamation point. In fact, please don’t.

### PRODUCTIVE ###
We want to help builders do their thing, fast. And so, let’s get to the point quickly. Less is more. Writing should be clear and helpful.

### HONEST ###
We don’t need fancy language to tell a good story. Our tone is factual and deliberate.


## Grammar and mechanics ##
We generally follow AP Style, with the noted exception that we do use the Oxford comma.

### CAPITALIZATION ###
Use sentence case everywhere. Yes, even in headlines.

|**Exceptions** | |
|:---|:---|
|Titles (e.g., product manager vs. Product Manager) | Titles are only capitalized when they immediately precede the person’s name. Title structure should be written as follows:<br/>Jess Vavra, senior director of design at Pendo, says, “...<br/>Senior Director of Design, Jess Vavra, says, “... |
|Acronyms | Some acronyms are so commonplace that your audience will immediately understand them (e.g., CRM). Others may be either esoteric, specialized, or unfamiliar to the particular audience you’re writing for at the moment. In these instances, spell out the term in the first use, and set the acronym apart in parenthesis. Then use the acronym in subsequent uses. For example, “Growth marketers have taken the commonplace MQL concept and applied it to the product itself, creating a Product Qualified Lead (PQL). The premise of the PQL …” |
|Pendo product names | Capitalize the names of Pendo’s product families and products (Engage, Adopt, In-app guides, Analytics, Feedback, Roadmapping, Mobile), but use lowercase when referring to the value delivered, “Pendo's product suite provides product managers with comprehensive analytics to inform data-driven decisions.”<br/>**Capitalize product names, but keep features lowercase.** |


### CONTRACTIONS ###
It’s ok to use them. They introduce a friendly, less formal tone to our writing.


## TIMES, DATES, AND NUMBERS ##
|**Type** | **Example** |
|:---|:---|
|Numbers | * One through ten, write out the word.<br/> * 11+ use the numerals.<br/> * We use K to designate thousands and M to indicate millions. |
|Times | HH:MM |
|Morning, evening | a.m. and p.m. |
|Date in headers | * MM/DD/YY (e.g., 01/11/20) in US<br/> * DD/MM/YY (e.g., 11/01/20) in Europe |
|Dates in body | Month ## (e.g., November 14) |
|Time zones | ET / CT / MT / PT |


## PUNCTUATION ##
|**Punctuation** | **Use** |
|:---|:---|
|Ellipsis (...) | An ellipsis is considered a word, thus it requires a space on either side. |
|Hyphen | Use a hyphen to link all words in a compound adjective, for example, “The product-led movement has accelerated since Pendo began writing about it.” |
|Semicolon (;) | If you’re reading this for writing guidance, please don’t use the semicolon; if you’re reading this as an editor, you probably can (but sparingly). |
|Colon (:) | Use it to introduce a list. But sparingly. |
|Oxford comma | Use it when introducing a list of things. |
|Exclamation point (!) | Avoid using it. |
|& and related symbols | In design, these symbols may be used. In editorial, use the word itself. |
|Quotes | End marks (periods, question marks) go inside the quotation marks. |
|Spacing | One space after a period. One space after a colon. One space after an exclamation point, but remember that we don’t use exclamation points. |
|Pendo as a possessive | We may use Pendo as a possessive (“Pendo’s new product …”), but do so sparingly. |

## PASSIVE VOICE ##
Writing in the passive voice is opaque and conveys a lack of confidence. In other words, use active voice.
