# Voice and Tone

The general guidelines in the [Pendo Brand Voice and Style Guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NA5n3Ac5lWPzANcUE7vVbaYnEcP1fDpkNK6RB7fpFlQ/edit#slide=id.g10f0d2d600c_0_1) are that we should sound:

**Friendly.** Speak to readers like smart, informed people, and look for ways to better relate to our audience, improve their experience, and help them achieve their goals. To this end, our writing should be:

*  Professional yet casual
*  Realistic yet warm
*  Enthusiastic
*    Generous with knowledge

**Direct.** Avoid ambiguity and jargon; aim for clarity and consistency, and don’t mask the message behind lofty language. To this end, our writing should be:

*  Straightforward
*  Unpretentious
*  Clear
*  Consistent
*  Confident

**Optimistic.** We aim to be passionate about the possibilities of the product, lead with curiosity, and avoid resorting to FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt). To this end, our writing should be:

*  Passionate
*  Hopeful
*  Authoritative

On top of this, we aim to adopt our own *tone* of voice in the Help Center.

## What are voice and tone?

Voice captures the persona behind the content or its “character”. Voice should be delivered with consistency across content. If your personality or messaging change too much or too often, it’s harder for readers to understand the purpose of the content or to trust it.

Tone captures the “attitude” with which we express our content. This is similar to the difference between “traits” and “states” in human psychology. You can be a friendly person (a trait), but also exhibit more or less friendliness (as a more transient state) depending on the situation or who you’re interacting with. In this example, “trait” corresponds with “voice”, and “state” corresponds with “tone”.

## Our tone of voice

In help documentation, it’s particularly important to avoid fatigue and frustration. We want the content to be as useful and as understandable as possible for getting the job done – as quickly as possible. To this end, we aim to write for the immediate goals of the reader, in plain English, and with short, direct sentences.

In sum, we aim to:

*  Refer directly to the reader.
*  Focus on what matters to the reader.
*  Write only what the reader needs to know to meet their goals.
*  Engage in “lean writing” to get to the point, quicker.
*  Use the active voice wherever possible.
*  Focus on the impact for the reader.
*  Suggest next steps for the reader.
*  Hone in on the user’s actions.
*  Use more verbs and fewer nouns.
*  Introduce concepts in the order in which the reader deals with them.

Our tone of voice is based on the purpose of content and the intended audiences. The high-level goals outlined for tone of voice include:

*  Be clear (direct, simple, precise, and concise)
*  Be human (conversational, personal, positive, and inclusive)
*  Be useful (professional, user-centric, and action-focused)

Some of the guidelines for meeting these goals overlap. For example, using the second person (“you”) makes it easier to write in the active voice (be clear), helps establish a conversational style (be human), and makes the content directly relevant to the reader (be useful).

### Be clear

Keep sentences short and simple with lean writing principles. Reduce wordiness and ambiguity about who or what initiates an action, especially in procedural steps, by using the second person with the imperative mood and active voice.

Other tips for writing clearly include:

*  Get to the point quickly.
*  Use plain English.
*  Use simple words where possible.
*  Break up content to make it more scannable.
*  Break up sentences into separate thoughts.
*  Check every word for redundancy and remove excess words.

Avoid:

*  Culture-specific references, including idioms, colloquial language, regionalisms, and slang.
*  Phrases with indirect or ironic meaning.
*  Humour, which can be misinterpreted or irritating.

### Be human

Keep your style informal and natural, even if relaying technical information to more tech-savvy users.

*  Use everyday language.
*  Be direct and conversational
*  Talk *to* users, not at them.
*  Adopt an informal and personal style.
*  Be friendly and positive.

|**Guidance** | **Example** |
|---|---|
|Choose short, simple, everyday words over long, formal, or complicated words.| “Help” instead of “assistance”, “let” instead of “enable”, “use” instead of “utilise”, “more” instead of “further”.|
|Use contractions to make content easier to read and less formal. | “Can’t” instead of “cannot” or “can not”, “you’re” instead of “you are”, “it’s” instead of “it is”. |
|Address readers directly to establish a personal tone. Use the second person in sentences.| “You” instead of “the administrator”, “the customer”, or “the user”.|
|Look out for words like “can’t” and “don’t” to re-frame sentences more positively.|“Sign in again to reconnect” instead of “You can’t reconnect until you sign in again”.|

### Be useful

Make your content about the reader or user. Make it obvious why content is relevant to the reader or user, and how they can act on it.

**Refer directly to the reader**

*  Understand what the reader or user needs to know to meet their goals.
*  Use the second person (“you”) in sentences about the reader or user.
*  Use the active (as opposed to passive) voice, where possible.
*  Focus on the impact for the reader or user.
*  Suggest next steps for the reader or user.

**Hone in on the reader's actions**

|**Guidance** | **Example** |
|---|---|
|Try starting sentences with a verb and using imperative sentences.| “Access your emails through the browser” rather than “We enable users to access emails through a browser.” |
|Focus on what the user can do, rather than the state of the system. | “If you get no output, investigate the input” rather than “If you get no output, there is a serious issue with the input.” |
|Use more verbs and fewer nouns. | “If you decide to…” instead of “If you make a decision to…”; “The system analysed…” instead of “The system conducted an analysis of…” |
|Write in the active voice, where the subject of the sentence performs the action (subject + verb + object construction). | “You can send emails from your phone”, rather than “Emails *can be sent from your phone*”. |
